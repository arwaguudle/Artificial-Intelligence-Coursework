# Artificial-Intelligence-Coursework
Repository for the Artificial Intelligence Coursework analyzing the California Housing Dataset and the UCI HAR Dataset (Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones).
# Setup Instructions:
## Dataset Preparation:
Download the UCI HAR Dataset and place it in the project root directory so the path becomes:
Artificial-Intelligence-Coursework/UCI HAR Dataset/

## Path Configuration:
In the code, replace the absolute path:
/Users/ahmed/Desktop/Artificial-Intelligence-Coursework/UCI HAR Dataset
with the the relative path:
.Artificial-Intelligence-Coursework/UCI HAR Dataset/
(and modify the front part of path depending on where you have cloned/downloaded the repository)

For the code to work, please ensure the the following libaries are installed:
>numpy,
>pandas,
>scikit-learn,
>matplotlib

## Key Notes:

It is worth noting that the GridSearchCV code file is included but was intentionally interrupted (KeyboardInterrupt) due to excessive runtime. This is preserved for reference purposes and to be shown as proof that it didn't work as mentioned in my report.
